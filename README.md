# Instant Messenger
In this project, I created a messaging application built using C and implemented the packet encoding and decoding for a basic instant messaging protocol. I used void pointers and pointer arithmetic, along with functions from 'string.h' to accomplish this. Additionally, I used techniques such as pointer arithmetic, raw memory access, and data serialization.
